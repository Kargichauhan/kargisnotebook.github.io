    <strong>Mathematics is a fundamental tool we use to describe, predict, and shape the natural world.</strong> It‚Äôs often seen as a core component of intelligence, requiring reasoning, planning, generalization, abstraction, knowledge, creativity, and even an eye for beauty. Throughout history, the way we do math has evolved, particularly the concept of a mathematical proof and the move from words to symbols. So let‚Äôs dive in :)
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Oh, hey there! Let me tell you about something really cool that people are working on‚Äîit‚Äôs like teaching computers to be super‚Äêmathematicians! It‚Äôs called <strong>AlphaProof</strong>.</em>

  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>
    You know how math is amazing? We use it to understand the world around us, build things, and even invent new stuff. People have been doing math for a <em>looooong</em> time, and proving things in math is super important‚Äîlike showing that something is true for sure. At first, proofs were just like telling a story with words, but over time, they became more precise, using symbols and special rules.
  </p>

  <h2 id="formalisation">Computer Formalisation of Mathematics</h2>
  <p>
    Now, imagine if we could get computers to help us with math! That‚Äôs where something called <strong>Computer Formalisation of Mathematics</strong> comes in. It‚Äôs like putting all the math knowledge into a language the computer understands perfectly. One of the special languages used for this is called <strong>Lean</strong>. Think of Lean like a super‚Äêprecise tool that helps mathematicians build and check proofs on a computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    There‚Äôs a huge project called <strong>Mathlib</strong>, which is like a giant library built by mathematicians using Lean. It has tons and tons of math knowledge, covering lots of different areas. The cool thing about putting math in a computer like this is that the computer can check if everything is perfectly right. It‚Äôs like having a helper who never makes a mistake when checking your homework!
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúComputer Formalisation of Mathematics: Putting all math knowledge into a language a computer understands perfectly.<br>
     Lean: A super‚Äêprecise tool for building and checking proofs on a computer.<br>
     Mathlib: A giant library of formalised math built in Lean.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    But getting computers to do math isn‚Äôt easy. It can be hard for people to learn the computer languages, and the computer libraries are still growing.
  </p>

  <h2 id="alpha-proof">How AlphaProof Works</h2>
  <p>
    Okay, so how does <strong>AlphaProof</strong> work? Well, it uses an idea called <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>, or <em>RL</em> for short. RL is like teaching a computer to learn by trying things out. Imagine teaching a robot to play a game: it tries something, and if it works, it gets a <strong>reward</strong>. If it doesn‚Äôt work, it doesn‚Äôt get a reward. By trying lots and lots of times, it figures out the best way to play and win.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might have heard of things like <strong>‚ÄúAlphaGo‚Äù</strong>. That was a computer that learned to play the super‚Äêdifficult game of Go just by playing against itself, starting from scratch! It even found new ways to play that humans hadn‚Äôt thought of. <strong>‚ÄúAlphaTensor‚Äù</strong> did something similar for finding super‚Äêfast ways to multiply numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The really awesome idea is: what if we could use this kind of learning for math? Math, especially using tools like Lean, is actually perfect for this! It‚Äôs like the computer gets a <em>perfect</em> signal‚Äîeither the math step it tried is totally right (a <strong>reward!</strong>) or it‚Äôs not (no reward). This perfect feedback lets the computer learn and get better all by itself, just like AlphaGo did for games.
  </p>
  <p>
    The big dream for <strong>AlphaProof</strong> is to reach <strong>superhuman intelligence</strong> in math and even discover new math truths, just like AlphaGo found new strategies in Go.
  </p>

  <h2 id="imo-apollo">The IMO ‚ÄúApollo Program‚Äù for Math</h2>
  <p>
    So, the AlphaProof team decided to try something really ambitious‚Äîlike an <strong>‚ÄúApollo program‚Äù</strong> to reach the moon! They wanted to see if their system could solve problems from the <strong>International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO)</strong>. The IMO is a super‚Äêhard math competition for the best young math students from all over the world. The problems are really tricky and can take even experts hours to solve.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the <strong>2024 IMO</strong>, they teamed up with another group working on geometry problems (called <strong>AlphaGeometry</strong>). AlphaProof focused on other types of problems, like algebra, number theory, and combinatorics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of these IMO problems aren‚Äôt just about proving something is true‚Äîthey ask you to find an answer first. AlphaProof was set up to work in a ‚Äúhard mode‚Äù‚Äîit had to figure out the possible answers itself and then try to prove if they were right or wrong. It even used another AI called <strong>Gemini</strong> to help guess possible answers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because they wanted AlphaProof to focus on the math solving part, they decided to give the system the problems already translated into that <strong>super‚Äêprecise computer language (Lean)</strong>, instead of the original words.
  </p>

  <h2 id="results">Results: Landing on the Moon!</h2>
  <p>
    So, how did they do?
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> AlphaProof got <strong>9 points</strong>. It solved part of an algebra problem (P1) and almost all of a number theory problem (P2). It didn‚Äôt make progress on a combinatorics problem (P3).</li>
    <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> AlphaGeometry solved the geometry problem (P4) perfectly and really fast‚Äîlike, in seconds! AlphaProof didn‚Äôt make progress on the combinatorics problem (P5) but solved a bit of an algebra problem (P6).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By the end, AlphaProof fully solved problems P1, P2, and P6. AlphaGeometry fully solved P4. Problem P6 was incredibly tough‚Äîhardly any human contestants solved it completely.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their total score was <strong>18 out of 42 points</strong>. This was enough to reach the score of a <strong>Silver medallist</strong> at the IMO! They just missed the score needed for a Gold medal.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <em>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like they successfully landed on the moon!‚Äù</em>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    They learned a lot from this. One challenge was that their math library (<strong>Mathlib</strong>) didn‚Äôt have everything they needed for some areas, especially geometry. The combinatorics problems were also super difficult for them. And, they used way, way more computer power than a person would.
  </p>

  <h2 id="next-steps">What‚Äôs Next for AlphaProof?</h2>
  <p>
    So, what‚Äôs next for <strong>AlphaProof</strong>? They want to teach it even more math, help it tackle problems at the very edge of what mathematicians understand, and eventually, make it a helpful tool for anyone who thinks about math.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>It‚Äôs pretty amazing</strong> what they‚Äôre building, trying to push the boundaries of what computers and people can do together in math!
